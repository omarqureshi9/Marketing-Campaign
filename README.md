# Marketing Campaign Data Visualization


This project visualizes and analyzes a dataset that contains marketing campaign data.

By analyzing different variables such as campaign duration, backer engagement, and promotional elements, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to enhance future campaigns.

## Dataset
This project used the following dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preethamgouda/campaign-data

The dataset is designed to provide insights into various aspects of crowdfunding campaigns, including:

Financial Goals and Funds Raised: Information about the financial targets set by campaign creators and the actual amount of money raised by the end of the campaign.

Campaign Characteristics: Detailed metrics that describe the campaigns, such as their duration, the number of backers, and the types of rewards offered.

Performance Indicators: Metrics that can be used to evaluate the success of a campaign, such as the percentage of the goal reached, the number of backers, and the average pledge amount.

Engagement Metrics: Data related to backer engagement, including the number of updates and comments on the campaign, as well as social media activity related to the campaign.

Promotional Elements: Information about marketing and promotional strategies used during the campaign, such as the use of social media, email newsletters, and partnerships with influencers.
## Findings
Through data preprocessing and visualization, the project found out that a campaign is deemed successful if the raised amount surpasses the goal amount. If the raised amount falls below the goal amount, the campaign is termed "not sucessful".


Additionally, if the raised amount for a campaign is above 100,000, it is sucessful. If the raised amount is 60,000 or below, the campaign is more likely to be to be unsuccessful than sucessful.
